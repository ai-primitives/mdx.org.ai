# MDX Frontmatter Structure

MDX files in this repository use a standardized frontmatter structure that combines required fields for documentation and optional fields for schema.org compatibility.

## Required Fields

Every MDX file must include these fields in its frontmatter:

- `$type`: The type of the MDX document (e.g., `https://mdx.org.ai/WebPage`)
- `title`: A descriptive title for the document
- `description`: A brief description of the document's purpose

## Optional Schema.org Fields

For schema.org compatibility, these fields can be included:

- `$context`: The JSON-LD context (typically `https://schema.org`)
- `$id`: Unique identifier for the document

## Examples

### Basic MDX File
```yaml
---
$type: https://mdx.org.ai/WebPage
title: Getting Started
description: Guide to getting started with MDX
---
```

### Schema.org Compatible MDX File
```yaml
---
$type: https://mdx.org.ai/BlogPost
title: Understanding MDX Frontmatter
description: A comprehensive guide to MDX frontmatter structure
$context: https://schema.org
$id: https://example.com/blog/mdx-frontmatter
---
```

### Package Documentation
```yaml
---
$type: https://mdx.org.ai/Package
title: MDX Parser

```

## Array Support

The frontmatter structure supports array values for any field when needed:

```yaml

## Implementation Notes

- All schema.org fields use the `$` prefix (e.g., `$type`, `$context`, `$id`)
- The `yaml` package is used for parsing frontmatter
- Fields are validated during build time
- Type definitions are generated from frontmatter structure
