# Overview



## Why MDX?

MDX is fully-compatible extension to Markdown, and Markdown is the native language of Large Language Models. Anytime you interact with ChatGPT or any other LLM,
it responds using Markdown to represent the rich formatting of the content.  

By extending, MDX brings together five core capabilities into a single format:

1. **Unstructured Content**: The Markdown content can be written in a free-form manner, with no restrictions on the structure or format, and can include links, images, etc.

2. **Structured Data**: YAML frontmatter provides a human-friendly format data format, and with JSON-LD @type attribute it can optionally have a strongly-typed schema.

3. **Executable Code**: Every MDX file is a Javascript/Typescript module, can import external packages or modules, and export variables or executable functions

4. **UI Components**: MDX can include JSX/React components, which can be used to create interactive UI elements, or to render complex data structures.

## JSON-LD

JSON-LD is a lightweight linked data format that allows you to describe your data in a way that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

```markdown
---
@id: https://example.com
@context: https://schema.org
@type: WebPage
title: Example Domain
---

# Example Domain

This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this
domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.

```

While the most @context for JSON-LD is [schema.org](https://schema.org), you can use any @context that you want, and [mdx.org.ai](https://mdx.org.ai) 
was created to extend [schema.org](https://schema.org) to provide a @context for MDX file types.  For example:

```markdown
---
@id: https://
@context: https://mdx.org.ai
@type: WebPage
title: Example Domain
---
```
