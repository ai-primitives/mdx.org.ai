# Why MDX?

MDX brings together unstructured content via Markdown, typed schemas via JSON-LD, structured data via YAML frontmatter,
executable code via Javascript/Typescript, and UI components via JSX/React.

## Generative AI

Most of the internet content that Large Language Models are trained on is in Markdown. Anytime you interact with ChatGPT or any other LLM,
it responds using Markdown syntax to represent the rich formatting of the content.

## Markdown

MDX is fully-compatible extension to Markdown, and Markdown is the native language of Large Language Models. Anytime you interact with ChatGPT or any other LLM,
it responds using Markdown to represent the rich formatting of the content.

## JSON-LD

JSON-LD is a lightweight linked data format that allows you to describe your data in a way that is both human-readable and machine-readable.

```markdown
---
$id: https://example.com
$context: https://schema.org
$type: WebPage
title: Example Domain
description: This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents
---
# Example Domain

This domain is for use in illustrative examples in documents. You may use this
domain in literature without prior coordination or asking for permission.

```

While the most common $context for JSON-LD is [schema.org](https://schema.org), you can use any $context that you want, and [mdx.org.ai](https://mdx.org.ai)
was created to extend [schema.org](https://schema.org) to provide a $context for MDX file types. For example:

```markdown
---
$id: https://example.com
$context: https://mdx.org.ai
$type: WebPage
title: Example Domain
description: Example domain demonstrating MDX.org.ai context usage
---
```

## YAML

YAML is a human-friendly data serialization language that is fully compatible with JSON. YAML frontmatter is a simple way to add structured data to your Markdown files.
