# Why MDX?

MDX is fully-compatible extension to Markdown, and Markdown is the native language of Large Language Models. Anytime you interact with ChatGPT or any other LLM,
it responds using Markdown to represent the rich formatting of the content.  

By extending, MDX brings together five core capabilities into a single format:

1. **Unstructured Content**: The Markdown content can be written in a free-form manner, with no restrictions on the structure or format, and can include links, images, etc.

2. **Structured Data**: YAML frontmatter provides a human-friendly format data format, and with JSON-LD @type attribute it can optionally have a strongly-typed schema.

3. **Executable Code**: Every MDX file is a Javascript/Typescript module, can import external packages or modules, and export variables or executable functions

4. **UI Components**: MDX can include JSX/React components, which can be used to create interactive UI elements, or to render complex data structures.

## Types

The [mdx.org.ai](https://mdx.org.ai) project provides @context for MDX files to have a specific @type that represents what it is. For example, a @type could be:
