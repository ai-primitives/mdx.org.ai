# API

You can build an API using MDX and web standards with the WHATWG Fetch API.

```mdx
---
$type: https://mdx.org.ai/API
---

export const fetch = request => Response.json({ hello: 'world' })

```

You can also export HTTP methods like `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, etc.

```mdx
---
$id: 'https://api.example.com'
$type: 'https://mdx.org.ai/API'
---

export const POST = async request => {
  const body = await request.json()
  return Response.json({ success: true, body })
}
```
